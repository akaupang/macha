## maNUAL chaRMM (macha)

#### Description
macha is meta-tool designed to (semi-)automate certain tasks related to setting up MD simulation systems. It is divided into a CLI front-end, written in bash, and a backend written in Python. The latter is accessible either directly or through the CLI frontend.

#### Installation

macha can be obtained by cloning this repository, issuing: 
`git clone git@github.com:akaupang/macha.git`

macha is also available as a conda package and can be installed in any conda environment with:
`conda install -c johanneskarwou -c conda-forge macha`

### Post-installation setup
After installation, the user must set the path to `cgenff` in `main.py` to be able to use CGenFF parameterization of ligands (not required for single- or double-stranded RNA, which are natively parameterized in CHARMM).

For the CLI interface to work, a few variables should be set at the top of `manual_charmm_system_setup.sh`. The `macha_py_base` *must* be set to point to the base directory of the python backend for this to be usable. A user can also choose to set the `charmm_bin_man` if a particular CHARMM binary should be used (by default, `charmm` is assumed to be in the $PATH). 

\# For convenient usage of the CLI frontend, we recommend setting an alias in your `~/.bashrc` to macha, like so:
`alias macha="/path/to/manual_charmm_system_setup.sh"`

\# Make sure that the `charmm` binary is in the $PATH or you have set a location in the script.
`export PATH="/path/to/charmm/bin:$PATH"`

#### Disclaimer:
Please note: This an early incarnation of macha, which may or may not be suitable for general use. We assume no responsibility for your use of the provided code.
The macha CLI interface assumes that you are working in a folder containing input scripts 
generated by CHARMM-GUI (https://charmm-gui.org/) and was designed to work with these scripts
in the state they were provided in the years 2022-2023.

The CLI interface intends to keep up with developments in the Python backend, but may not
always be up to date. Please inspect and/or use/modify the python scripts directly if you
encounter any problems.
